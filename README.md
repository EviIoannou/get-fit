# get-fit

## Project description 
Welcome to 'Get Fit'! An easy game to help you get to know your nutrition and training routines better. How well do you know your food? Is it as healthy as you think? 
Which type of training is it better for you based on energy your food gives you? Find out by playing 'Get Fit'!

## Notes
This is an educational game on how healthy our choices are. Energy and health points were assigned to each card in consultation with a physiologist/nutristionist and are based on real values. However, these points should not be confused with the exact nutritional values of different food or energy spent on different types of training. The purpose of the game is to educate in a more general way and to have fun at the same time!
